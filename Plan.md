1. **Setup and Configuration**:
   - Begin by setting up your project environment, including installing Node.js and initializing a new Next.js project.
   - Configure Firebase by creating a project on the Firebase Console and setting up authentication and Firestore.
   - Create a `.env.local` file to store your Firebase configuration and other environment variables.

2. **Authentication Setup**:
   - Start by implementing authentication functionality.
   - Create authentication pages/components such as sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out pages.
   - Initialize Firebase authentication in `firebaseConfig.js` and handle user authentication using Firebase Auth SDK.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Integrate Firestore into your application to store shuttle routes, schedules, and user data.
   - Implement Firestore rules to control access to your database.
   - Create necessary collections and documents in Firestore to store data related to shuttles, routes, and user profiles.

4. **User Interface Development**:
   - Begin building the user interface by creating layout components such as Header, Footer, and NavBar in the `components/Layout` directory.
   - Develop authentication-related UI components like SignInForm, SignUpForm, and SignOutButton in the `components/Auth` directory.
   - Style these components using CSS modules or another styling approach of your choice.

5. **Authentication Pages**:
   - Implement the authentication pages (signin.tsx, signindriver.tsx, signup.tsx) in the `pages/auth` directory.
   - Use the authentication UI components created earlier and integrate them with Firebase authentication logic.
   - Style the authentication pages to match your project's design.

6. **Database Functionality**:
   - Create Firestore utilities in the `lib` directory to handle database operations.
   - Implement logic to fetch and display shuttle routes, schedules, and other relevant data from Firestore.
   - Develop UI components for displaying shuttle routes, schedules, and tracking information in the `components/Shuttle` directory.

7. **Driver Functionality**:
   - Implement pages and components specific to shuttle drivers in the `pages/driver` directory.
   - Develop functionality for driver route selection, live tracking, and dashboard views.
   - Style the driver-specific pages and components accordingly.

8. **Analytics Integration**:
   - Initialize Firebase analytics in `firebaseConfig.js` using `getAnalytics`.
   - Implement event tracking for user interactions and shuttle-related activities.
   - Integrate analytics data into your application for monitoring and analysis.

9. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test each feature and page to ensure functionality and responsiveness.
   - Debug any issues or errors encountered during testing.
   - Use browser developer tools and Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing and debugging.

10. **Deployment and Documentation**:
    - Deploy your Next.js application to a hosting provider like Vercel or Firebase Hosting.
    - Configure environment variables for the production environment.
    - Write comprehensive documentation for installation, usage, and maintenance of your project.
